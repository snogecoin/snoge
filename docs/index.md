$SNOGE is a reflectionary token inspired by HOGE, WOGE, and the other strains of OGE. With a 2% transaction fee, holders will be able to maximize their participation in our upcoming cannabis projects & partnerships.

</p>

Unlike other reflectionary projects, $SNOGE and our partners can be used as collateral to create real-world synthetics tied to cannabis stocks & assets. As such, our token benefits holders & traders via lending & staking in our in-development seigniorage which captures real-world profits from our partners!

The decentralized & censorship-resistant nature of Ethereum allows our project to reach cannabis-savvy investors & partner projects who understand the untapped merits of cannabis as much as we do. Our team is composed of experienced blockchain developers & cannabis investors who are pooling their resources to maximize the outreach of cannabis assets.

As a community focused project, our immediate goals are to give back to cannabis research, charities, and unjustly persecuted communities. According to the Last Prisoner Project, **15.7 million** people were arrested for marijuana offenses in the last decade. Not only does our team believe in the financial freedom afforded by decentralized finance & blockchains, we believe in the untapped financial & medicinal freedoms afforded by the cannabis & medical marijuana industries.

By capturing even 0.1% of the annual revenue generated by the $20 billion legal cannabis market globally, we can efficiently redistribute resources into empowering the cannabis community & effectively reform archaic beliefs about cannabis use & products.

Our team is currently developing a novel NFT-based multi-signature vault that allows all of our participants to comfortably donate to our targeted charities, voted upon by our governance. Our platform will be entirely open source, so stay tuned! 

While you wait, please give some support to Snoop Dogg this April 20th by checking out his recently launched NFT collections & his online store.
