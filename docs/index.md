## Take the Kushiest Moonride with $SNOGE

Bridging real-world cannabis assets & securities to the blockchain through novel reflectionary synthetics & seigniorage

$SNOGE Ethereum Contract address: 
- **0x072c46F392E729C1f0D92a307c2C6DBA06B5D078**

**2% slippage required on Uniswap!**

- [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0x072c46F392E729C1f0D92a307c2C6DBA06B5D078)

$SNOGE is a reflectionary token inspired by HOGE, WOGE, and the other strains of OGE. With a 2% transaction fee, holders will be able to maximize their participation in our upcoming cannabis projects & partnerships.

Unlike other reflectionary projects, $SNOGE and our partners can be used as collateral to create real-world synthetics tied to cannabis stocks & assets. As such, our token benefits holders & traders via lending & staking in our in-development seigniorage which captures real-world profits from our partners!

The decentralized & censorship-resistant nature of Ethereum allows our project to cannabis-savvy investors & partner projects who understand the untapped merits of cannabis as much as we do. Our team is composed of experienced  

As a community focused project, our immediate goals are to give back to cannabis research & charities. Our team is currently developing a novel NFT-based multi-signature vault that allows all of our participants to comfortably donate to our targeted charities, voted upon by our governance. Our platform will be entirely open source, so stay tuned!
